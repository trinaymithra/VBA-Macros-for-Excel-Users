NOTE:

Before enabling this macro, few other rules have to be enabled.

I'll explain how
* Select whole sheet by clicking on bottom triangle left to 'A'and above '1' (Headings)
* Home on Ribbon -> Conditional Formatting -> New rule -> 'Use a formula to determine which cell to format'
* Paste '=OR(CELL("row")=CELL("row",A1))' in formula field
* Customize the format(Select your color, border etc. from the menu)
* Click 'OK'
* Now paste the above macro in the VBA Editor
* Alt+Q to exit the VBA editor

Now you can see the row being highlighted on selecting any cell from that row
